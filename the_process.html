        <h3>The process</h3>
        <p> 
            We will start by determining which trees are suitable for holding a treehouse, and then look at some sample
            plans to get an idea of what is possible and indicative costs. Next we will work out the size, layout and
            style of the treehouse and come up with some draft plans. After deciding on the plan to proceed with, we
            contract an engineer to go through the design and ensure that it will be safe and stable, now and as the
            tree grows. Once the plans are finalised, I will organise any necessary building consent and construction
            can begin.<br><br>

            The building process starts with the platform, and after this has been constructed rigorous testing will
            take place to ensure that it meets the highest standards. Next we will add the wall framing and install the
            roof before building the floors, walls, entrances, windows and railings. If your treehouse has a particular
            theme, this is where we will add the little touches that bring that to life, such as doorknobs, lighting and
            decorative elements. Lastly comes the really fun part as we add those special extras such as slides,
            bridges, fire poles, zip lines and climbing nets to make your treehouse really stand out!<br><br>
